# Github Actions allows for running jobs on a wide variety of events
on:
  push: # Commits pushed to Github
  pull_request: # Pull request is update
  workflow_dispatch: # Manually dispatched from Github's UI
  schedule: # Run at the first day of each month
    # This can detect external factors breaking the tests (such as changes to libraries or CL implementations)
    # Syntax follows that of cron
